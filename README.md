Data gathering + visualizing the days people sign up for Reddit

This is the original code I wrote in 2015 for this project. Within the past year, I had updated the code to be less...lazily...written, which will be pushed once I clean it up a bit :)

For the results, I uploaded the site onto GitHub pages, which can be seen [here](https://shirtandtieler.github.io/CakedayCrawler-Visualization). In case the calendar heatmap does not show up, you may need to download the page from [its repo](https://github.com/shirtandtieler/CakedayCrawler-Visualization).
